# How to use

1. Go to this pages's Github.io webiste, seen on the right. 
2. Do one of two things:
   - Upload a csv file of the format (lastname, firstname).
   - Paste all names in the format (lastname, firstname) as seen in the example on the Github.io website.
3. (Optional) Change the organization name from the default ``Provo YSA 19th Ward`` to your organization's name.
4. Change any advanced features you would prefer (e.g. distance between cards, font size, etc.)
5. Click the download button




# Example output

Here's an example, using the following input:

Note that two extra boxes were made.

4 boxes will appear per page, whether they are filled or not.


### Appendix A: Creating CSV


1. Place all of your names in this style in a Notepad-like file:
```
lastname, firstname
Doe, Jane
Doe, John
```
2. Save the file using whatever name preferred, and make sure to append ``.csv`` to the end.

NOTE: If the first column is every last name and the second column is ever first name, saving an excel file as a csv will accomplish the same task.
