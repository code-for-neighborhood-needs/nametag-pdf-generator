Note that two extra boxes were made.

4 boxes will appear per page, whether they are filled or not.


### Appendix A: Creating CSV


1. Place all of your names in this style in a Notepad-like file:
```
lastname, firstname
Doe, Jane
Doe, John
```
2. Save the file using whatever name preferred, and make sure to append ``.csv`` to the end.

NOTE: If the first column is every last name and the second column is ever first name, saving an excel file as a csv will accomplish the same task.
