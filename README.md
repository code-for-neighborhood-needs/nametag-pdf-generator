Made with vibe coding.

# How to use

1. Go to this pages's Github.io webiste, seen on the right. 
2. Upload a csv file of the format (lastname, firstname). This can be done two ways, as seen below.
3. (Optional) Change the organization from the default "Provo YSA 19th Ward" to your preferred organization.
4. Change any advanced features you would prefer.
5. Click the download button

### Use Notepad

1. Place all of your names in this style in a Notepad-like file:
```
lastname, firstname
Doe, Jane
Doe, John
```
2. Save the file using whatever name preferred, and make sure to append ``.csv`` to the end.

### Use Excel
If the first column is every last name and the second column is ever first name, saving an excel file as a csv will accomplish the same task.
